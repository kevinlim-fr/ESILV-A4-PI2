# PI2 Data extraction + text mining
This project is a data extraction and text mining project. It this composed of two parts.

## PART 1 : Data Extraction from text and tables in PDF
- Preprocessing of PDF files to increase the readability of a PDF file and correct the orientation
- Doing OCR using orcmypdf (based on tesseract) to recognize the text and apply it to the pdf
- Using a table extractor library (Camelot) to identify the table type (lattice or stream) and create a dataframe based on the structure of the data.

## PART 2 : Text mining using NLP, regular expressions
- Work in progress
